# Project Happy Thoughts API

This week's project was to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data. When the Api was finished we where to replace an old API in an previous frontend project with the newly built.

## The problem

This week was a bit easier than last week, but i still struggled with deploying on Heroku and the understanding on how to connect with MongoDB and also using postman.

I created all the endpoints needed for the previous frontend which was requierd for the blue level. After connecting the frontend with my own API Url I got help from a team member to add a delete request in the backend and then create a delete button to delete posts in the frontend, which was superfun!! I think that was when I understood how it is all connected :D
